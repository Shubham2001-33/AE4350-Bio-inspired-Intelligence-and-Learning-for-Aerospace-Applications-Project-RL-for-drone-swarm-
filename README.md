# AE4350-Bio-inspired-Intelligence-and-Learning-for-Aerospace-Applications-Project-RL-for-drone-swarm
In this project, the application of Q-learning is explored to enable efficient coordination and navigation
of a multi-agent drone swarm. The main objective here was to implement an autonomous system that allows a
group of drones to collectively accomplish a specific task (area coverage) while avoiding collisions and optimizing their
trajectories.

Run the Qlearning Drone Swarm.py file.
Parameters can be changed in config.yml file.

Suggested: 
Visual Studio

This project makes use of the gym environment contained in the Minigrid library: https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid
